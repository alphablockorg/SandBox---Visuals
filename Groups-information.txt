********** SP500 ************

Exceptional & Rich U.S. 500 consists of the 500 large cap equity in United States. The sandbox studies the following factor portfolios with their respective number of components. The VCG 500, G 100, V 100, VG 200, and C 300. The benchmark for the group is S&P 500. 4732 simulations were run. On average, the factor models delivered an annualized excess return up to 9% for the study period of 6 years since 2016. G 100 was the top performer across different periods and rankings. G, VCG, and VG had the highest Annualized Excess Returns and highest Information Ratios among the five factors with Tracking Errors in the range of 5% to 8%. VG and C had the least Tracking Error, while V 100 had the least Information Ratio among all the factors. The sandbox continued to highlight the poor performance of Value [V], the neutrality of Core [C], and the superior risk-return tradeoff with Growth [G], Value Growth [VG], and the Value Core Growth [VCG] method. The VCG had the highest number of components among all the factors and hence was the best overall factor model to compare with the benchmark.
